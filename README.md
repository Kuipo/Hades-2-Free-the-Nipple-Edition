# Hades 2 Free the Nipple Edition

Like its predecessor, Hades 2: Free the Nipple Edition modifies the sprites of Hades 2 to be spicier while still staying true to the game's original visual style.

Unlike its predecessor, it is a Team Project:
Package compiled and uploaded by Kuipo.
Art compiled and created by Eddyboy, involving contributions by Dorian Bates, Medician and Emikochan.

This is currently developed for the 1.1 release of Hades 2. NOTE: You must be using high resolution textures to see the replacement images.

## Features

- Modifies some of the effects such as glint, glow, and wiggle where appropriate to adjust for the changes in the armor
